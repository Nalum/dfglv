# Dwarf Fortress Go Legends Viewer (DFGLV)

This is a small application that allows you to view the exported legends from Dwarf Fortress. I decided to write this because I have not found a native linux app and also to help me learn Go.

To use this please download the latest release or you can compile it yourself using Go. I will be focusing on Linux builds of the app but it should also work fine on other systems supported by Go.
